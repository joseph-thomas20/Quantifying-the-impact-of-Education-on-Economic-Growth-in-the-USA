# Quantifying-the-impact-of-Education-on-Economic-Growth-in-the-USA
For the Economic Data Analysis module of my Economics and Data Science MSc I was tasked with producing a 2,000 word paper that applied my knowledge of Data Analysis to an economic topic of my choice. 

Following news that education standards and economic growth in the United States of America have significantly decreased in the last 5 years, this paper assesses whether essential plans to develop the quality of education delivered to students in the United States could also become an integral component of plans for economic recovery, following the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is done using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach to estimate parameters of a linear-mixed effects model designed to investigate the significance of education on the economic growth of OECD countries. This study finds that education quality has a significant positive relationship with annual GDP growth rate per capita, therefore implying that improving education quality will significantly contribute to long-term plans for economic recovery.

I have included the full paper in this repo. 
Codidng done in STATA to follow the guidelines set by the module coordinator, I will be returning to execute the code in another language at a later point.
